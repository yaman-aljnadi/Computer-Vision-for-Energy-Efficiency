The dataset includes 1107 images.
Something are annotated in YOLOv11 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Grayscale (CRT phosphor)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise

# Computer-Vision-for-Energy-Efficiency
This project explores the use of computer vision techniques to improve energy efficiency analysis through satellite image segmentation. By using deep learning architectures, image enhancement methods, and data augmentation, we aim to evaluate how different dataset variants and model choices affect segmentation performance.

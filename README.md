# Describtion 
This projects looks into identifiing what is the best model that can be used for segmenting houses and similar objects from satellite images, there are three images and object detection models architicures used in this project: 
* YOLOv11: yolo11x-seg.pt
* Detectron2: Mask RCNN_X_101_32x8d_FPN_3x
* MMDetection: Mask RCNN_x101-64x4d_FPN_2x

# Requiremtns: 
```Python 3.9.21```

# Computer-Vision-for-Energy-Efficiency
This project explores the use of computer vision techniques to improve energy efficiency analysis through satellite image segmentation. By using deep learning architectures, image enhancement methods, and data augmentation, we aim to evaluate how different dataset variants and model choices affect segmentation performance.
